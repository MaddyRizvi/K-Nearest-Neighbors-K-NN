# üß† K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier on Social Network Ads Dataset

This project implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** classification model on a dataset containing **Age** and **Estimated Salary** features. The goal is to train the model to **predict the probability of whether a person will make a purchase or not** based on these features.

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Social_Network_Ads.csv`: Dataset file (must be uploaded in Colab runtime).
- Python script (in a Colab notebook) with the following steps:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature scaling
  - Model training (K-NN)
  - Predictions
  - Accuracy and confusion matrix evaluation
  - Decision boundary visualization for both training and test sets

---

## üöÄ How to Run in Google Colab

1. **Open this Notebook in Google Colab**  
   If you're not already in Colab, upload the notebook or open it from GitHub.

2. **Upload the Dataset**  
   Use the following cell to upload `Social_Network_Ads.csv`:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()
   ```

3. **Run Each Code Cell in Sequence**  
   The code will:
   - Preprocess the data
   - Train the model
   - Show prediction results
   - Visualize the decision boundaries for training and test sets

4. **Prediction Example**  
   The model predicts output for a new user with age 30 and estimated salary of $87,000.

  - `metric = 'minkowski'` with `p = 2` (Euclidean distance)
- **Evaluation**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy Score
- **Visualization**:
  - Colored decision boundaries for both training and test data
